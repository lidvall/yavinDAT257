##Social contract

All members have signed a social contract detailing rules and routines as well as expectations and goals of the project.

This agreement can be found here: *[Social contract](https://github.com/lidvall/yavinDAT257/blob/a4532cd61d487f0cc8760105861429ab06577ae4/methodology/yavin_social_contract_final_signed.pdf)*

## Project plan
The project is based on the application of agile principles, where Scrum has been chosen as the specific framework. In order to visualize and strucutre this work, we use the integrated project planning tool in GitHub. It is basically the same thing as Trello etc.
