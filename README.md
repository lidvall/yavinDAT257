## Social contract

All members have signed a social contract detailing rules and routines as well as expectations and goals of the project.

This agreement can be found here: *[Social contract](https://github.com/lidvall/yavinDAT257/blob/a4532cd61d487f0cc8760105861429ab06577ae4/methodology/yavin_social_contract_final_signed.pdf)*

## Project plan / Scrum board
The project is based on the application of agile principles, where Scrum has been chosen as the specific framework. In order to visualize and strucutre this work, we use the integrated project planning tool in GitHub. It is basically the same thing as Trello etc.

The following link will take you straight to it: *[Project plan](https://github.com/users/lidvall/projects/1/views/1)*

# Repository structure

## src
Contains all files associated with the application itself, i.e sourcecode, executables etc.

## methodology
Contains all files related to the methodological side of the course, i.e social contract, individual- and team reflections etc, including the final reflection.

## Execution of the program
There is a jar file in the project folder which can be executed in order to run the program. Download the repository as a zip, extract and run the file.

## Contribution Statistics
The statistics of each team members contribution is available in the main project folder under the file "Git Statistics", the statistics are pulled from Git Insights (the native github feature) as we were not able to get gitinspector to work due to some suspicous errors (we contacted our supervisor Kevin Ayad about this and he were not able to assist us), but the statistics drawn from Git Insights should show the same figures.
The actual statistics can also be found here: https://github.com/lidvall/yavinDAT257/graphs/contributors
