# Individual reflection - Lukas Lidvall - W4

### What do I want to learn or understand better?
- I have not worked that much with api-requests in java before and that is one of the things that I want to get better at through this project, after that I want to further strengthen my data-visulation skills in java as well. I have done this frquently in python and look forward to broaden my use of java libraries. 

### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
- I can utiliize my expereince doing similar things that we are trying to acomplish in this project in other lanuges and with outher datasources and maybe teach someone how to think regarding data visualization in generall, and thereby  strengthen their ability in java etc.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
- I am present at all meetings, and I try to keep the board updated in a better manner as opposed to previous weeks where this was not done to the fullest extent.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
- This week I contributed mainly by finding a "proxy" stakeholder for this project, as well as the team reflection including raising my suggestions for KPI's etc. I also took some time to get up to speed on the coding strucuture of the class that I am tasked with to expand.
