- ### What do I want to learn or understand better?

I want to better understand how the data retriveval process works technically, but also deepen my knowlegde with regards to the broader scope of data science, the importance and functionality of open-data etc. 

- ### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

I am very interested in statistics and I hope that I can contribute with my skills witihn that area in order for the team to get a better understanding of what the product actually acomplishes.

- ### What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

This week my main contribution in ternms of scrum methodologies is my active participation in the scheduled group meetings and use of the project plan board, however we agreed that we all should improve our update frequency of that board moving forward.


- ### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

My biggest contriubtion this week is a set of view mockups, where I showed what data and how that data should be visualized to the user. Apart from that I was engaged in and was the meeting secretary during our team reflection.
