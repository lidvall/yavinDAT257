# Individual reflection - Johan Birgersson - W4

- ### What do I want to learn or understand better?
- I have previously not worked with git in the correct way, my usage of branches has been completely off and I understand that the right usage would result in multiple beneficial effects such as better visibility, better testing of ideas and of course better collaborations. I seek to learn from Lukas Wigren about correct usage and implement it in this project further on.

- ### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
- This week i helped some of my teammembers to learn about different ways of to query data, specifically about POST requests, and setting up a basic Client for sending such requests. This is something i was previously not aware of but I came to understand the usefulness of APIs using this form of queries and thus identified the need to get aquainted with the use of them.
- ### What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
- I try to to keep the team on the agenda during semi-daily scrums, which is not always easy as there are multiple crossing items to discuss. But i feel that when it is successful, it is because people are reminded of the objective of the meeting and when we subsequently get back on the correct path we are able to get ahead with the most pressing matters leaving room for other topics that rose during the meeting.
- ### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
- This week we are delivered a team reflection along with some code contributions. In terms of code contribution I worked with Lukas Wigren to match our code and later reviewed it with the entire team. It is now suitable for expanding on.
