# Individual reflection - Erik Hillestad Andreasson - W6

- ### What do I want to learn or understand better?
Same as last week. Basically improve on producing well-written code to help other team-members that are currently spear-heading the code-related decisions.

- ### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Same as last week. Nothing concrete, but being there available for the team for everyone to get on the same level, or if anyone wanted to bounce ideas.

- ### What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Also same as last week. Team-reflection, engaged in team-meetings, and using the scrum-board. 

- ### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
After deliberation with our stakeholder, we got some feedback regarding the data and its visualization that we had added last week. This week I helped with adjusting some graphics-related issues according to the feedback + further searching for a complete dataset that includes all the datapoints that our stakeholder now has stated that he prefers.
