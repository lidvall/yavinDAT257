# Individual reflection - Johan Birgersson - W7

- ### What do I want to learn or understand better?
I feel that I have learnt from other teammembers how to best import libraries. Right now, we are looking at wrapping the project up. I have learnt that it's easy to underappreciate the effort required to do so. Next time, i will be voting for more time spent on this.

- ### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

I think the finding that in each teammembers next project we need to leave more time to finishing up all features.

- ### What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

We finished strong with the usual suspects, review, retrospective etc. Looking forward to hearing what everyone thinks once we are finished.

- ### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

Basically same as last week, more graphing.
