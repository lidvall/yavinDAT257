# Individual reflection - Johan Birgersson - W3

- ### What do I want to learn or understand better?
- Open data query - I have done it before, but want to become more comfortable with it. I seek to use prior course knowledge and use the java Stream class and make it more stable than other quick route approaches i have previously taken.
- ### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
- We could have divided tasks by least prior experience and thus forced ourselves to learn those topics. However as we all had some previous experience with the set of tasks we took the fast route to get started. Hopefully at later stages of the project we are able to find time to take the more resource consuming and learning approach.
- ### What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
- I send out calendar invites for each meeting with a preset agenda, and have been doing so since the team formed at the beginning of the course.
- This helps keeping a red thread through the meetings and facilitates assurance that the purpose of each meeting is met. Going forward the agenda will look different compared to previous versions. We will now start coding on tasks and thus we will have more frequent meetings in the format of daily scrums, that is, what have everyone done, what issues are you dealing with, and how we plan ahead. Im eager to try this format and see the outcome.
- ### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
- This week we are delivering a team reflection along with some code contributions. I have been tasked with writing the query functionality and will hopefully contribute a stable version of that. In regards to the team relfection we have planned for a meeting on thursday to collectivley reflect on the work being done.
