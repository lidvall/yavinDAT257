# Individual reflection - Johan Birgersson - W2

- ### What do I want to learn or understand better?
- Currently I am looking to learn the initial steps of a sprint-start-up i practice and hopefully allow for an optimal project start.
- ### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
- During this week I contributed with my prior knowledge of using a BMC, and clarified the meaning of different aspects. I beleive it is faster to share information in the team instead of having everyone read up on the topic. I hope to recieve such learnings from my teammembers along the work with the project.
- ### What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
- This weeks deliverable mainly consisted of selecting our project for the upcoming weeks. I took on the initiative to formalize selection criteria; Realistic based on our current coding experience and capacity, utilizing open data, open data availability verified.
- The project selection was as follows; Each member ideates on a project idea with the requirements in consideration. In the following meeting we internally pitch our idea along with justifications for sustainability aspect, data-availability and pro- cons. After each pitch we used dot-voting (each team-member was given 5 dots to distribute weighted votes). We thus arrived at our current project.
- Furthermore I prosposed an inital plan for the sprints, and initial suggestions for appropriate tasks for the first sprint. This is currently undecided.
- ### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
- In the same meeting as we selected our project we collectivley worked with the mock-up as well as the business model canvas, we where able to quickly assess the scope of our application and currently no questions remain. Next week will be devoted to setting up the tasks for the first sprint and begin work.
