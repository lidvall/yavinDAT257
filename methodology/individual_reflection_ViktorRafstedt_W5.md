- ### What do I want to learn or understand better?

This far into the project, besides minor details here and there I don't think there are any major areas that I've found this week that I wish to understand better.

- ### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

Same as last week.

- ### What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

Same as last week as well as discussing the feedback that we recieve from our stakeholder and how it best can be implemented.

- ### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

Improvment and added features to the GUI.
