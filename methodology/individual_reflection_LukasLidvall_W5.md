# Individual reflection - Lukas Lidvall - W5

- ### What do I want to learn or understand better?

At this stage in the project I feel like there is not much left that I want to understand better. It's more of a situation where aim to put my technical understanding and agile project management skills in to practice as much as possible. Litteraly just "practice what I (we) preach" in order to get better at it as opposed to learning something brand new.

- ### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

Pretty much the same approach here as last week, but more focused on the finishing touches of the project.

- ### What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

Same approach as last week, not really implementing anything new, more strengthening the level at which we practice previous learnings. 

- ### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

Extending data scope and cleaning sorting/index files to be used in our application.
