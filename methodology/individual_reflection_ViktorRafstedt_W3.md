- ### What do I want to learn or understand better?

Firsly I need to refresh my skills in Java swing as it will be needed whilst I create the main portions of the GUI. Secondly, I want to develop my skills within datascience so that I can visualize and present the data in the GUI in a rewarding and understandable way.

- ### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

In order to help the team, I hope that I can come up with a design for the GUI (design as in code structure) so that it will be easily understandable for the rest of the group to both build up-on and to ensure that the rest of the program fits with the GUI code strucutre.

- ### What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

My main contribution this week is hard to pinpoint, but as we develop or processes in the use of scrum the project plan board gets more frequently updated and more well strucutred, which I've helped the team achieving this week.

- ### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

My contribution towards the team deliverables was mostly developing knowledges this week around different coding areas which will be crucial in the upcoming development phase.
