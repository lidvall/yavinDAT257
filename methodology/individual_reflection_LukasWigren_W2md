# Individual reflection - Lukas Wigren - W2

- ### What do I want to learn or understand better?

In the upcoming week we are going to start developing the program we have planned the last two weeks, hopefully I can learn a thing or two about the kickoff of a sprint, and how to deal with the challenges of working in a bigger team. 

- ### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

So far I have not been able to teach someone so far, but hopefully next week when we kickoff the first sprint I will be able to help the team with the structure of the program in a way that achieve a Model-View-Controller architectural pattern. Which will help us develop and add future features to the software.

- ### What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

I gave my perspective of what ideas were fit for this project, not only to achieve one or more Millennium Development Goals, but also something that would fit in our time-limit which can be developed further if needed.

- ### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

I looked over and helped finish the business model, as well as the project scope.
