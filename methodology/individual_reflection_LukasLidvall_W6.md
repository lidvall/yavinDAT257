# Individual reflection - Lukas Lidvall - W6

- ### What do I want to learn or understand better?

Pretty much the same thoughts as last week however I now have focus a little bit more on making sure we take all of our stakeholders minimum requirements in to account and also ensuring we manage to deliver what has been promised.

- ### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

Taking on the same stance as last week, I focus on helping the team by practising what we preach and also provide statistical/"data-science" related feedback so that our implemented software reflects reasonable statistical conventions so to say.

- ### What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

Same approach as last week.

- ### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

Focused on extending data visualization scope to include the sufficent amount deemed by our stakeholder.
