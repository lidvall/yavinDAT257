- ### What do I want to learn or understand better?

Continuing on a topic I discussed last week, I wish to improve my skills with software design as the design of the GUI in combination with other features of the program has proven itself to be somewhat difficult when taking into account that it should allow for expansion where the data don't necessarily has the same structure.

- ### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

Based on what I've learned so far, I can share my knowledge regarding GUI design with my team as well as how to efficiently combine a GUI with the backend.

- ### What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

Somewhat same as last week, but my main contributions has been to be both present and driving at all team meetings as well as making effecient use of the project board updated

- ### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

A basic first iteration version of the GUI.
