# Individual reflection - Erik Hillestad Andreasson - W2

- ### What do I want to learn or understand better?
Today, friday, I want/looking forward to learn & understand better the agile sprint workflow which we are about to start next week when the strict planning-phase of the project has ended. Moreover, I also especially look forward to becoming a better software engineer during this project.

- ### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Currently, I still believe that I best can help the team to stay on course on both group-meeting, tasks and the project overall. Other than this, I don't have a particular edge regarding either programming or agile work methodologies over my group-members. However, I still feel that I'm a valued group member, even though there isn't any clear edge other than being able to be a steady voice in the group.

- ### What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
At the end of last week, we had a group-meeting where we were "brainstorming" ideas, however, this proved to be a relatively inefficient use of our time with a minimum gain in value for the project. Thus, I recommended that we instead find some alternatives (with pre-checked requirements) on our own time, where we later reconvened and pitched the ideas. This proved to be a much more efficient way (where everyone had a clear task until the next group-meeting), as 15 minutes into the next meeting we had heard all pitches and decided on the current project.

- ### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This week I helped decide and expand on the project idea & scope. Moreover, from the initial idea, I helped create the business model canvas and powerpoint for the presentation as well as showed my presence by presenting a part of the project during the presentation this week.
