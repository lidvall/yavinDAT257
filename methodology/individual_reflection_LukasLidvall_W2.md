# Individual reflection - Lukas Lidvall - W2

- ### What do I want to learn or understand better?

I want to strengthen my knowledge in terms of practically working according with agile principles. I have some theoretical knowledge of the subject but I have never really used it in practice.

- ### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

At this stage in the project it is mainly my project management experience and design skills that have helped the other members the most. Moving forward my biggest contribution will porbably be outside of the roam of pure technical skills.

- ### What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

My biggest contribution this week is aparet from my continued implmentation of the scrum board my active participation in our group meetings.

- ### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

My contribution to this weeks deliverables is my part in the idea, project scope and business model canvas and the desgin mockup which I took the lead on. I also partcipated in the presentation of the project.
