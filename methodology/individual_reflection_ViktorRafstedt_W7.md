# Individual reflection - Name - WX

- ### What do I want to learn or understand better?

Last week I talked about project delivery, but this week I felt that I needed more knowledge in "project closing", i.e. when to call it quits on adding new features and how to prioritize what really matters in the end.

- ### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

Same as last week.

- ### What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

Same as last week.

- ### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

Made the GUI more visually appealing as well as adding new features to the GUI.
