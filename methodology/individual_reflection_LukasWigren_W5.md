# Individual reflection - Lukas Wigren - W4

- ### What do I want to learn or understand better?

Since we're pretty far into the project, I don't feel like there's much left to learn. At least not that I can come up with.

- ### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

With the new code introduced and UML created I can show and teach how the program works and how to futher implement more functionalities to the program.

- ### What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

Adding things to the scrum board. Continue to teach the usage of branches to achieve higher quality code.

- ### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

I contributed with some code, and I helped with the weekly team reflection. I also created an UML for the team to better understand the structure of the classes.
