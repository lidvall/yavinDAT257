# Individual reflection - Lukas Wigren - W4

- ### What do I want to learn or understand better?

My usage of the scrumboard has been lacking a bit, and I need to get better and use it more often. Perhaps its because my knowledge of the scrumboard process is still lacking. 

- ### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

In case any teammate needs further help or explanation how to create a branch or pull-request, I will be available to explain and show how its done.

- ### What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

I used my knowledge to show the team how to use branches and pull-requests, in purpose that we will gain higher quality code by implementing a checkpoint where the code will be peer-reviewed.

- ### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

I contributed with some code, and I helped with the weekly team reflection.
