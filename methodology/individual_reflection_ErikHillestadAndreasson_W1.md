# Individual reflection - Erik Hillestad Andreasson - W1

- ### What do I want to learn or understand better?

I'm looking forward to experiencing the celebrated agile work-methodology in practice, rather than just reading about it. Therefore, I want to learn as much as possible about this style of project-management to hopefully apply it more efficiently in the future, and to finally reflect on the pros and cons of the agile workprocess compared to other styles of project-managements.

- ### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

From this week's group-conversation I feel that I can help the team with keeping ourselves to the main objective at hand, and not letting any one member spiral out to a less relevant tangent/dead-end. Aside from that, I hope to share knowledge and experience of problems from other group projects that I've previously run into both in this Computer Engineering Program but also from my MSc in Finance.

- ### What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

I think that my forthcoming contribution to the agile workprocess framework is to regurarly monitor the scrumboard and checking up on team member's progress on certain issues to ensure that noone has spiraled on their own path or that they feel that they are a part of a team with a common goal. No one should feel left behind on a task.

- ### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

This week, I helped with the social contract as well as maintaining a healthy discussion and brainstorming meeting with the team. Moreover, during this meeting we started formulating tasks for the scrumboard.
