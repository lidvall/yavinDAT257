# Individual reflection - Name - WX

- ### What do I want to learn or understand better?

I want to collect an experience of working with agile methods in software development. I’m interested in reflecting on the workprocess and how to see too which degree it helps us work efficiently.

- ### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

My previous studies have been heavily project management related with some aspects (mostly by own initiative in assignments) focused on agile methods. Albeit, these assignments have been considering enterprise agile and not in software development. Albeit, I have a good grasp of agile in software development and the tools utilized. Hopefully, this experience will be contribute to the planning phase and understanding of each steps and method we encounter in the work process.

- ### What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

See above.
- ### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

This week deliverable was social contract and I contributed by input that we rather have it simple than to complex and not followed.
