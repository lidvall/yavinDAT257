# Individual reflection - Johan Birgersson - W4

- ### What do I want to learn or understand better?
- Nothing particularly for this week 
- ### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
- We still had some aspects unclear about post requests so I had to devote some time explaining these as some members still opted what they considered a better approach to data retrieval. Through an analogy i managed to explain how their proposed approach would be very time-consuming.
- ### What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
- I try to to keep the team on the agenda during semi-daily scrums, which is not always easy as there are multiple crossing items to discuss. But i feel that when it is successful, it is because people are reminded of the objective of the meeting and when we subsequently get back on the correct path we are able to get ahead with the most pressing matters leaving room for other topics that rose during the meeting.
- ### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
- I worked with all teammembers on the team reflection, another point to add is that i set the agenda for the preceeding meetings. Furhtermore, some  code contributions where delivered.
