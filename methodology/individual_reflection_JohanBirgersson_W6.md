# Individual reflection - Johan Birgersson - W4

- ### What do I want to learn or understand better?
- I want to get a better understanding of how to import libraries in a way that is sustainable for large projects. We are currently looking at using maven, I seek to get better at importing dependecies within this framework. 
- ### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
- As scrummaster, I propose tasks ahead, and the team generally relies on me delegating tasks. Which I do to facilitate easy progress. But I can also use this a mechanism to guide some new topics to people i know are unfamiliar with them. This will expand their toolkit for future projects.

- ### What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
- I made some adjustments to our scrumboard, implementing different views with the aim to increase the use of labeling for tasks which will significantly simplify the review process.
- ### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
- This week we also delivered a team reflection along with some code contributions. I worked with the Party class, i spent a little to much time going down the wrong route, in stead of just making the code work i opted for an optimal approach which took me far longer. I knew the simple way to do it all along however, as I wanted to get better at custom methods for objects I spent much time trying to create Objects as keys in a hashmap, in the end i scrapped this as it took me to much effort and went ahead with more pressing tasks such as documentation.
