- ### What do I want to learn or understand better?

Same as last week with the addition of how to efficiently deliver a project to a client as the project is starting to come to an end.

- ### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

In essence same as last week, I want to both help the rest of the team learn how to integrate features into the GUI as well as learning from the team how the features they create can be implemented in the GUI.

- ### What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

Same as last week.

- ### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

I kept on expanding the user interface where I integrated some features that have been added to the backend as well as expanded what can be done in the GUI.
