# Individual reflection - Lukas Lidvall - W7

- ### What do I want to learn or understand better?

I am not really learning anything new at this stage, I instead have more of a focus on understanding how the project should be delivered in the end etc. Like how does one actually deliver a product to the customers/stakeholders after working on it for this relativly long amount of time.

- ### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

Same thoughts and focus as last week.

- ### What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

Same thoughtss and focus as last week.

- ### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

Fixed the last needed data-sources etc. and overall made sure all other deliverables where up to spec.
