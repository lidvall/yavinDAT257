# Individual reflection - Erik Hillestad Andreasson - W3

- ### What do I want to learn or understand better?
Same as last week. Due to miscommunication, our group did not decide on 1 sprint each week. We instead read from the course material (slides) that sprints can be anywhere between 1-4 weeks each. Therefore, due to our chosen project, we decided that 2 sprints would fit the project best. However, this was an error since we, again, were supposed to do 1 sprint each week. My guess is that this structure is mandatory in order to increase the students understanding of the agile sprint workflow methodlogy. So until next week, I really wanna aim at learning/understanding how to break small projects into many more sprints, i.e., identifying more user-stories inbetween our current ones.

- ### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Hopefully, keep everyone on the same track regarding the project and what needs to be done in each task. I don't know if I can teach anyone something new completely, but at least help each person come up to speed on certain topics that they might be behind on.

- ### What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I participated in each and every meeting from start to finish, unlike some others that had to leave early from one of our meetings this past week. Moreover, I contributed by keeping the project board up to date as well as bringing the 1sprint/week information to the group which forced us to start rethinking the entire structure that we had already started on.

- ### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
See above + Me and Lukas Lidvall decided and created some mockups for suggested views for our project, as well as researched additional databases from which we can retrieve more information from and hopefulle combine with our current data.
