# Individual reflection - Lukas Lidvall - W1

- ### What do I want to learn or understand better?

I want to experience how agile principles affect the software development process, will we work more efficiently? Will the end product have a higher level of quality / give more value than previous projects where no specific processes or methodologies was used?

- ### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

I have a relatively wide experience of project based work and to some extent agile principles mainly through previous studies in business administration. Hopefully I can contribute by showing how for example scrum has been used in a non-software development setting, and thereby indicate to someone with better development skills than me how one can use the framework.

- ### What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

In regard to the framework, I contribute with firstly some general knowledge of how the framework is used and also by implementing specific tools that support the use of Scrum. For example we settled on using the integrated project plan tool in GitHub on my initiative. Here I prepared the digital Scrumboard and during our first group meeting the other members came with some very valuable feedback on how we could improve it.

- ### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

This week deliverable was the social contract and my main contribution was that I initiated the process of formulating it and where also the one writing it technically during our meeting. Though not a part of this week's deliverables I also contributed by setting up our repository with the appropriate files, templates and structure etc.
