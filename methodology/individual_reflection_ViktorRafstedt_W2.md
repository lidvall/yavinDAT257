- ### What do I want to learn or understand better?

Going forward, I look forward to acctually be able to practice the agile methodology and experiencing how it is to work in a sprint settings. However, honestly the thing I look forward to the most is the software development section of our project and make our plan come to life.

- ### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

Developing on what I wrote last week, I hope to be able to help my teammembers and develop my own coding skills when we kick of the coding. Early on, it will be crucial to develop a clear structure and who does what as well as making sure everything fits together, something that I have experience with and hope to be able to help my team with.

- ### What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

My main contribution this week was mainly the development of the business model canvas, which I developed the template for and in which I structured or project idea. Together with my teammates, I also suggested and discussed extension and limitations to our project so that it would be both complicated enough so that we all would learn something new, but simple enough so that we know we could acctually complete the project in a satisfactory manner.

- ### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

Same as above.
