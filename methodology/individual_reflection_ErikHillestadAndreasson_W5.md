# Individual reflection - Erik Hillestad Andreasson - W5

- ### What do I want to learn or understand better?
Thus far, from working a couple of weeks now into the project with the correct structure I feel that I've understood what criterias to meet when creating new User stories and tasks to be sufficiently small to fit into the smaller sprint-durations. From now on, my main aim is to increase my understanding of Java, and try to add as much value as possible in the code. Other than this, there is not really that much that is concrete, that I want to learn at this moment. 

- ### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Same as the two last weeks. As well as help anyone in the team with further understanding the concepts, requirements, and mindset that the course is trying to adhere to, if anyone feel like they need additional help/another perspective with understanding this.

- ### What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Same as last weeks. Helped with team reflection, enganged in the team-discussions on how to proceed and/or if there were any design-decisions that had to be taken.

- ### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Adding to the use-cases by retrieving additional data, and planning appropriate views and functions to maximise value for the customer.
