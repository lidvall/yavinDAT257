# Individual reflection - Viktor Rafstedt - W1

- ### What do I want to learn or understand better?

I want to gain knowledge about how agile processes affects the outcome of the project, and specifically learn about agile processes enough so that I'm able to relate it to other methodologies and compare outcomes and the reasons for the outcomes.

- ### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

Regarding project work in specific, I have fairly extensive experiences from working in it through working as a consultant and previous studies. However, I have limited experiences in working with the agile methodology, although I have taken courses in project management which included the agile methodology. I thus hope that I can contribute with my overall knowledge of project mangagement which might help in the project, and in extent learn more about the agile methodology.

- ### What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

Regarding the the use of scrum, my main contribution will likely be the monitoring of both other team-members tasks and my own, in order to ensure that all members strive towards the same goal and to ensure that discussions on potential problems arises sooner rather then later.

- ### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

This week we mainly focused on our social contract, and thus aiding in the creation of the contract were one of my main contributions. Besides the contract, we also hade several both structured and non-structured discussions about the upcoming project.
