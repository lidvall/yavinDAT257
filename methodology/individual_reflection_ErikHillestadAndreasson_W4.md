# Individual reflection - Erik Hillestad Andreasson - W3

- ### What do I want to learn or understand better?
At the moment, my previous statements still stand. I want to know more about the agile way of working as our methodologies and knowledge about it aren't really up to par to truly apply to the project yet. However, we are trying to improve.

- ### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I can help with keeping everyone on the same level when it comes to the tasks at hand if anyone hasn't been available for meetings or just simply need a recap.

- ### What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I've been semi-active on the meetings this week as I've been busy working during one of our scheduled meetings. However, this was only meant to be a rare occurance as I was really needed at work and could be filled in with meeting details concerning the course later.

- ### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This week I've been practicing my java knowledge to be able to expand on the already written code. Moreover, I've also looked for additional databases to grab information from and drafted some ideas about what the best options are.
