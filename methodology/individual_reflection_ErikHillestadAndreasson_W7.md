# Individual reflection - Erik Hillestad Andreasson - W7

- ### What do I want to learn or understand better?
I feel that I've gotten a lot better in my understanding of writing good java-code from spending time in my free-time to further my overall understanding by watching videos and practicing in certain areas that were more unclear to me when the course started. Therefore, there is not anything specific that I feel that I want to learn better which fits in the course's scope.

- ### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Same as all the other weeks. 

- ### What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
- Same as the last week. Our last team-reflection, engaged in our team-meetings by partly focusing on the group's decisionmaking and reflecting on why we took certain decisions during the period of this project.

- ### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This week I could actually add some value by writing useful code. I implemented a new database (per the stakeholder's request) and made it work into the existing code. (very proud)
