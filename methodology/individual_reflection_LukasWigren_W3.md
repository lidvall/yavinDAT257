# Individual reflection - Lukas Wigren - W3

- ### What do I want to learn or understand better?

Since our API is using JSON, I want to learn how to effectivly convert it to a java class, using proper datastructure, where we then can use the data within the application.

- ### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

Since a lot of future work is going to be programming, I hope that I can be of help when/if someone is wrestling with problems occuring during the devopment progress. 

- ### What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

I assessed the user stories to check if the they met the INVEST scrum criteria. This includes assessing time and evaluating if the tasks are sizable. 

- ### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

This week I worked with the weekly team reflection. I have also done a dab of programming.
