# Individual reflection - Lukas Wigren - W1

- ### What do I want to learn or understand better?

I want to have a deeper understanding of the process of working with agile software development, especially how to implement it in practice.

- ### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

Although my experience working on a project in a larger groups might be lacking, I hope that my problem-solving capability within the development department might teach someone how to solve certain problems. And write code that is "pretty", easy to read.

- ### What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

Hopefully my experiene withing software development can help us estimate the time it will take for us to complete certain tasks. But also evalute if the program is satisfying the customers' demands and expectations. 

- ### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

This week we put together a social contract, were I gave my input and thoughts on the matter. Since I agreed with most of the points stated, my contribution was mostly agreeing with what was being expressed.
